                        <p class="card-text">I am an 1989 Honors Graduate of Wheelock College in Boston, Massachusetts, where I earned my B.S. in Early Childhood Education with a double minor in Day Care and Special Education. My husband and I have four children. We both grew up in East Bridgewater and love our connection with this community.  I have been operating both schools (Whitman and East Bridgewater) since 1989 â€” 30+ years! I oversee the academic and daily activities of all our programs and meet regularly with teachers and staff. I am very much involved in all aspects of Busy Bee, interacting daily with both childcare locations and I take great pride in the fact that Busy Bee is a family-owned and operated business. Beyond directing Busy Bee, I am a member of the East Bridgewater Business Association. I have also been a member of the PTO for 20 years and held an office for 7 years. I am passionate about providing support to many local programs such as providing scholarships to local high school students who are pursuing Education and Early Education in College. I strive to make Busy Bee the best we can bee for your children and family!</p>

                Busy Bee's success has been built over the past 30+ years by its <em>outstanding</em> teachers. With many of them teaching at Busy Bee for over 15 years, they have obtained the knowledge and qualities to make your child's first school experience a memorable one.
                
                All staff have completed background checks including: CORI, SORI, DCF & Fingerprinting and they also receive First Aid, CPR, and Rescue Medication training. These trainings are ongoing with both EEC and Busy Bee regulations. Our policy and practicum training is offered in-house by veteran teachers. Assistants undergo training as well, and are under the supervision of certified staff members. Each teacher and aide must meet and maintain all requirements by EEC and Busy Bee to remain a part of our team.
                
                We strive to keep our staff well educated with the changing of times and believe that old-school values complimented with newer teaching styles helps create the perfect balance within our classrooms. Our staff strives to establish and maintain a positive, encouraging relationship with students and families. They possess all of the qualities that make our center the best!
